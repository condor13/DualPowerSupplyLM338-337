Linear Power Supply for Synthesizers (+12V, -12V, +5V)
A high-quality, low-noise linear power supply designed specifically for analog synthesizers. This project replaces standard regulators with LM338 and LM337 to ensure high current overhead and superior thermal stability.

Features
Triple Rail Output: +12V, -12V, and +5V rails.

High Current Capability: Equipped with LM338 (5A) for positive rails and LM337 (1.5A) for the negative rail.

Audio Grade Filtering: Uses a multi-stage filtering approach with 2200µF primary capacitors and 100µF/100nF output decoupling to minimize ripple.

Adjustable Precision: Multi-turn trimmers allow for exact voltage calibration (e.g., exactly 5.00V).

Robust Protection: Includes 1N4007 back-EMF protection diodes on all stages.

Optimized PCB: Dual-layer ground plane design for EMI shielding and thermal dissipation.

Hardware Specifications
Input: Transformer with 18V-0-18V and 10V secondaries.

Regulation: LM338T (Pos), LM337T (Neg).

Thermal: Designed for external heatsink mounting with electrical isolation.

PCB Layout
The PCB is designed with wide power traces and a "Star Ground" philosophy to prevent ground loops in sensitive audio circuits.
